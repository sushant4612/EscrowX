## 💰 Staking & Rewards

### Arbitrator Staking:
```
Initial Stake: 10-1000 XLM
Purpose: Gain voting power
Locked: Until you unstake
Voting Power: Stake ÷ 10
```

### Vote Staking:
```
Per Vote: 10+ XLM
Purpose: Skin in the game
Locked: Until dispute resolves
Risk: Lose if vote with minority
Reward: Bonus if vote with majority
```

### Reward Calculation:
```
Total Losing Stakes: 10 XLM (from minority voters)
Winning Voters: 2 arbitrators
Bonus per Winner: 5 XLM

Winner 1: 15 XLM stake + 5 XLM bonus = 20 XLM returned
Winner 2: 20 XLM stake + 5 XLM bonus = 25 XLM returned
Loser: 10 XLM stake lost
```
