## Common Issues

### "I don't see the job in Freelancer dashboard"

**Check:**
1. âœ… Did you use the correct freelancer address?
2. âœ… Are you connected with the freelancer wallet?
3. âœ… Did you switch to "Freelancer" role?
4. âœ… Is the job created? (Check Client dashboard)

**Debug:**
- Open browser console (F12)
- Look for: "JobList - Total jobs: X"
- Check if your wallet address matches

### "Job appears in Client but not Freelancer"

**Reason:** You're probably still connected with the client wallet.

**Solution:**
- If using same wallet: Just switch to Freelancer role
- If using two wallets: Disconnect and connect the freelancer wallet

### "I created a job but it disappeared"

**Check:**
- Browser console for errors
- LocalStorage: `localStorage.getItem('jobs')`
- Make sure you didn't clear browser data
