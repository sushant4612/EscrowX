## 💰 How Staking Works

### Arbitrator Staking:
```
1. Go to Arbitrator Dashboard
2. Enter amount (min 10 XLM)
3. Click "🔒 Stake Now"
4. Approve Freighter transaction
5. XLM locked on blockchain ✅
6. Gain voting power!
```

**Voting Power Formula:**
```
Voting Power = Total Staked ÷ 10
Example: 50 XLM staked = 5 voting power
```

### Vote Staking:
```
1. Review dispute evidence
2. Enter vote stake (min 10 XLM)
3. Vote for Client or Freelancer
4. Approve Freighter transaction
5. XLM locked until dispute resolves
```

**Rewards:**
```
Vote with majority = Get stake back + bonus
Vote with minority = Lose stake
Bonus comes from losing voters' stakes
```
