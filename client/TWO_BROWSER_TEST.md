# Test on Two Different Browsers

## ✅ Now Works Across Browsers!

I've added **BroadcastChannel** which allows browsers on the same computer to communicate.

## 🧪 How to Test

### Browser 1 (Chrome) - Client

1. Open Chrome
2. Go to http://localhost:3000
3. Connect Wallet A (Client)
4. Switch to "Client" role
5. Click "+ Create New Job"
6. Enter Wallet B address (from Browser 2)
7. Amount: 10
8. Description: Test job
9. Click "Create Job"
10. ✅ Job created!

### Browser 2 (Firefox) - Freelancer

1. Open Firefox
2. Go to http://localhost:3000
3. Connect Wallet B (Freelancer)
4. Switch to "Freelancer" role
5. **Job appears automatically!** ✅

## 🔄 How It Works

- **localStorage**: Stores jobs locally
- **BroadcastChannel**: Sends updates to other browsers
- **Auto-refresh**: Checks every 3 seconds
- **Instant updates**: Other browsers get notified immediately

## 📋 Full Test Sequence

### Setup:
- Browser 1: Chrome with Wallet A
- Browser 2: Firefox with Wallet B

### Test 1: Create Job
```
Chrome (Client):
1. Create job for Wallet B
2. Job appears in Chrome ✅

Firefox (Freelancer):
1. Job appears automatically ✅
```

### Test 2: Mark Complete
```
Firefox (Freelancer):
1. Click "Mark Completed"
2. Status changes ✅

Chrome (Client):
1. Status updates automatically ✅
2. "Approve" button appears
```

### Test 3: Approve
```
Chrome (Client):
1. Click "Approve & Release Funds"
2. Status changes to APPROVED ✅

Firefox (Freelancer):
1. Status updates automatically ✅
2. Job moves to "Completed & Paid"
```

## 💡 Tips

- Both browsers must be on **same computer**
- Both must be open at **same time**
- Updates happen **instantly** via BroadcastChannel
- Also polls every 3 seconds as backup

## 🐛 If Not Working

1. **Refresh both browsers**
2. **Make sure both are on localhost:3000**
3. **Check browser console for errors**
4. **Try creating a new job**

## ✅ Success Checklist
