## 🧪 Testing with Multiple Wallets

### Setup:
- **Wallet A:** Client (creates job)
- **Wallet B:** Freelancer (completes job)
- **Wallet C, D, E:** Arbitrators (vote on dispute)

### Test Flow:

**Step 1: Create Dispute (Wallet A or B)**
```
Browser 1 (Wallet A - Client):
1. Create job for Wallet B
2. Wallet B marks complete
3. Reject with evidence
4. Dispute created ✅
```

**Step 2: Try to Vote as Client (Wallet A)**
```
Browser 1 (Wallet A):
1. Switch to Arbitrator view
2. Dispute NOT visible ❌
3. Message: "No disputes available for voting"
4. Reason: You're the client
```

**Step 3: Try to Vote as Freelancer (Wallet B)**
```
Browser 2 (Wallet B):
1. Switch to Arbitrator view
2. Dispute NOT visible ❌
3. Message: "No disputes available for voting"
4. Reason: You're the freelancer
```

**Step 4: Vote as External Arbitrator (Wallet C)**
```
Browser 3 (Wallet C):
1. Switch to Arbitrator view
2. Dispute IS visible ✅
3. Can stake and vote
4. Reason: Not involved in dispute
```

## 📊 Dispute Visibility Matrix

| User Role | Can See in Dashboard | Can Vote |
|-----------|---------------------|----------|
| Client (involved) | ✅ Yes (Client view) | ❌ No |
| Freelancer (involved) | ✅ Yes (Freelancer view) | ❌ No |
| External Arbitrator | ✅ Yes (Arbitrator view) | ✅ Yes |
| Random User | ❌ No | ❌ No |

## 🎯 Filtering Logic

### Code Implementation:
```typescript
const activeDisputes = disputes.filter((d) => {
    const isActive = d.status === 'ACTIVE';
    const isNotInvolved = d.client !== publicKey && d.freelancer !== publicKey;
    return isActive && isNotInvolved;
});
```

### What This Does:
1. **Checks status:** Only ACTIVE disputes
2. **Checks involvement:** Excludes if you're client OR freelancer
3. **Returns:** Only disputes you can vote on

## 🔍 How to Verify

### Check if You Can Vote:

**Method 1: Switch to Arbitrator View**
```
1. Go to Arbitrator dashboard
2. Look for "Active Disputes" section
3. If empty: You're involved in all disputes
4. If visible: You can vote on those disputes
```

**Method 2: Check Browser Console**
```javascript
// Get all disputes
const disputes = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('disputes') || '[]');

// Check your involvement
const myAddress = 'GXXX...'; // Your wallet address
disputes.forEach(d => {
    const canVote = d.client !== myAddress && d.freelancer !== myAddress;
    console.log(`Dispute ${d.id}: Can vote = ${canVote}`);
});
```
