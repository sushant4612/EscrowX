# Current Limitation Explained

## ‚ùå What Doesn't Work

**Scenario:**
```
Computer A (Wallet A - Client):
- Create job for Wallet B

Computer B (Wallet B - Freelancer):
- Job does NOT appear ‚ùå
```

**Why?**
- localStorage is browser-specific
- Data saved in Browser A cannot be seen by Browser B
- Each browser has its own separate storage

## ‚úÖ What DOES Work

**Scenario 1: Same Wallet**
```
1. Connect Wallet A
2. Create job with Wallet A as freelancer
3. Switch to Freelancer role
4. Job appears ‚úÖ
```

**Scenario 2: Same Computer, Same Browser**
```
1. Connect Wallet A (Client)
2. Create job for Wallet B
3. Disconnect Wallet A
4. Connect Wallet B (Freelancer)
5. Job appears ‚úÖ
```

- See SUPABASE_SETUP.md

### 2. Firebase (15 min)
- Google's backend
- Easy setup

### 3. Custom Backend (1 hour)
- Full control
- Node.js + MongoDB/PostgreSQL
- Deploy to Railway/Heroku

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Can I test with two different wallets?**
A: Yes, but only on the same browser. Disconnect one, connect the other.

**Q: Will it work on different computers?**
A: No, not with localStorage. Need backend (Supabase).

**Q: How long to add backend?**
A: 10 minutes with Supabase.

**Q: Is localStorage bad?**
A: No, it's perfect for single-user testing. Just not for multi-computer.
