## 🎯 How Stellar Accounts Work

### Account Activation:
On Stellar, an account doesn't exist until it receives its first payment.

**Minimum Balance:**
- New accounts need at least **1 XLM** to be created
- This is called the "base reserve"

**Account States:**
- ❌ **Not Activated:** Address exists but never received XLM
- ✅ **Activated:** Address has received XLM and exists on network
