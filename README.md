### 🚀 Decentralized Freelance Marketplace  
**Zero Fees • DAO Governance • Blockchain Security**

---

## 📖 Overview

**EscrowX** is a **decentralized freelance marketplace** built on the **Stellar blockchain**, providing **trustless escrow** and **DAO-based dispute resolution** — all with **zero platform fees**.

Traditional freelance platforms like **Upwork** and **Fiverr** charge 10–20% commissions and rely on centralized, biased dispute systems.  
EscrowX replaces them with **transparent**, **instant**, and **community-governed** blockchain escrow.

---

## 💡 Problem

Freelancers and clients currently face:

- ❌ **10–20% platform fees**
- ❌ **Centralized & biased dispute resolution**
- ❌ **Payment delays & lack of transparency**
- ❌ **Geographic restrictions**

> 💸 Over **$3.7 billion** is lost annually in fees to centralized freelance platforms.

---

## ✨ Solution

**EscrowX** uses the **Stellar blockchain** to create a **trustless escrow** system and a **DAO-based dispute resolution** mechanism.

**Key Features:**
- ✅ 0% platform fees  
- ✅ Decentralized & fair disputes  
- ✅ Instant 5-second payments  
- ✅ Global accessibility  
- ✅ Transparent, on-chain operations  

> Freelancers keep **100%** of their earnings.  
> Clients get **fairness and security** — without middlemen.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Client creates job** → Funds locked in Stellar escrow  
2. **Freelancer completes work** → Client reviews  
3. **If approved** → Funds automatically released  
4. **If disputed** → DAO arbitrators vote (2/3 majority)  
5. **Funds automatically release** to the winner  

> ⚡ Entire flow runs on **Stellar**, no smart contract deployment required.

## 🧠 Why Stellar?

| Feature | Stellar | Ethereum | Solana |
|----------|----------|-----------|---------|
| TX Fee | $0.00001 | $2–50 | $0.001 |
| Finality | 5 sec | 15 sec | 0.4 sec |
| Escrow | Native | Smart Contract | Program |
| Complexity | Low | High | Medium |

**Why EscrowX chose Stellar:**
- 🔹 5-second transaction finality  
- 🔹 Near-zero fees  
- 🔹 Native multi-signature escrow  
- 🔹 No need for complex smart contracts  

---

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### **On-Chain**
- **Stellar Blockchain:** Native accounts used for escrow  
- **Freighter Wallet:** Secure signing by users  
- **DAO Voting:** 3 arbitrators decide disputes on-chain  

### **Off-Chain**
- **Supabase:** Encrypted escrow secret storage  
- **Next.js 15 + TypeScript:** Modern, performant frontend  
- **Framer Motion + Shadcn UI:** Smooth animations, elegant dark theme  
- **Vercel Edge Network:** Global scalability and performance  

---

## 🔐 Security Highlights

- 🔒 Funds locked immutably on Stellar  
- 🔑 Escrow secrets encrypted via Supabase  
- 🧩 Freighter ensures private keys never leave browser  
- 🚫 Arbitrators prevented from voting on their own disputes

## ⚖️ DAO Governance

**Dispute Resolution Workflow:**

2. Randomly selected 3 arbitrators review evidence  
3. Majority (2/3) vote determines the winner  
4. Smart automation releases funds accordingly  

**Future Enhancements:**
- Arbitrator staking & slashing  
- Reputation & scoring system  
- Randomized arbitrator selection for fairness
